There are two programs that perform basic molecular gas
simulations within a box. The first program (gas1) uses
a time slicing technique and the second program (gas2)
uses a discrete event scheduling simulation method. Gas
molecules are travelling at constant velocity, therefore,
it is easy to -ahead of time- calculate the next collision
time for any number of gas molecules (thereby making the
discrete event approach possible).

The inspiration for these programs came from one of 
A.K. Dewdney's books on computer recreations (chapters 
originally appeared in Scientific American).

Each program prints records of the form:

#-of-molecule   X-position  Y-position

Any number of initial molecules may be specified. One
can change the NUM_BALLS value to be something other
than 4 (the current value).
