How to get and install SimPack3:

    # English statements such as this one begin with a pound-sign, 
    such as the one at the beginning of the previous line, and are
    used to indicate procedures the details of which you provide, 
    or to provide helpful info or hints.  Such statements may continue for
    several lines, as this one does, but will end with a blank line.
    Everything ELSE below is a Unix command and should be typed as shown.
    (Such Unix commands do NOT begin with a pound-sign.)  See, for example, 
    the first such command ("date") below.

    # Log into a Unix system.

    date

    # Choose an appropriate directory in which you wish to locate simpack
    and change directory to the directory you chose.  SimPack3 will 
    install everything under its own (relative) root directory, which
    will have the name "simpack", and which will be created automatically as
    a subdirectory of the directory you have chosen. So if your home
    directory is, say, "~fred", and you change directory to your home 
    directory to do the SimPack3 install, you'll end up with a directory 
    "~fred/simpack", under which all of SimPack3 will be installed.  You
    need NOT create the simpack directory.  It gets created automatically
    as part of the procedure below.  The ONLY files that will end up in
    "~fred" in this example are:
        (1) the SimPack3 "tar", which you may optionally
            move or remove after its contents have been extracted
            (discussed further below); and,
        (2) SimPack3.doc (this file), which you may also remove during
            or after installation, as it also appears as the file 
            "Readme" in the simpack root.

    ftp ftp.cis.ufl.edu

    # When prompted for userid, respond with

        anonymous

    # When prompted for a password, respond with your complete internet 
    userid, which is something like whoever@xxx.yyy.zzz.

    binary
    cd pub/simdigest/tools
    get SimPack3.tar.Z

    # May take awhile depending on how skinny your wire is and how heavy
    the traffic is.  SimPack3.tar.Z as you receive it (a compressed tar)
    weighs in at just over 1.4 MB.

    get SimPack3.doc

    # SimPack3.doc is THIS document you are reading.

    bye
    ls -l
    uncompress SimPack3.tar.Z

    # Uncompress takes under a minute on my system.

    ls -l

    # After you uncompress, SimPack3.tar is 5 MB, and SimPack3.tar.Z
    is gone.

    tar -xvf SimPack3.tar

    # Extraction takes about 1 minute on my system.  You may wish to keep the
    tar or, to save space, you may remove it at this point.

    ls -l

    # In the directory you have chosen you will see the tar file (unless
    you just removed it to save space) PLUS you will see the root directory
    of SimPack3, which is named simpack.

    cd simpack
    du -s .

    # Code extracted from tar: 4.9 MB (will show as something like "4862  ."
    in the output of the du command above.

    make all

    # "make all" takes about 6 minutes.
    Code after make all: 13.3 MB
    See Make_all.log in simpack root, either BEFORE you make all, to
    see what to expect, or AFTER make all, to compare with our results.

    # "make clean" takes about 20 seconds.  Takes you back to what you
    got from us and extracted from tar.  If you added any source code
    it will not be deleted, but all object files will be deleted, as
    will all backup files (*~), etc.  See Make_clean.log in simpack 
    root, BEFORE you make clean, to know what to expect.
    
    # See Shiptar.log.  Among other things, it'll list the contents of
    the tar by filename (including path) and size.  It's our packing list.

    # There are formal manuals in postscript form as well as many readme
    files.  You can locate these with

        find . -name '*.ps' -print
        find . -name 'README' -print
        find . -name 'Readme' -print
        find . -name 'readme' -print

    # The above may be a good place to start with SimPack3.  You may have a
    better grasp of the theoretical framework if you also look through Dr.
    Fishwick's book.
