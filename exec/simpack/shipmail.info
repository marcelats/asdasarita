You have requested to receive the SimPack simulation toolkit by mail.
As many as 16 or 17 files will be mailed to you by this program. Please 
do the following as you receive the files:

1) Save the message in a file by the SAME NAME as found in the
   SUBJECT line. This is important since it is possible that you
   can receive files out of order even though they are sent in
   sequence.
2) Strip off the mail header from each mail file.
3) Concatenate all of the files that you receive (using the Unix
   command 'cat' for example) to form one large file.
4) Follow the instructions at the head of the large file.
