This simulates a time Petri network composed of places and transitions.
Transitions can take time while places do not take time. The simulator
builds an 'outset' table first to reduce the iterative lookup for
transitions that can fire. Note the following input file format:

#transitions #places #time
time #input-places i-place-0 i-place-1 .. #output-places o-place-0 ...
time #input-places i-place-0 i-place-1 .. #output-places o-place-0 ...
...
#tokens-in-place-0 #tokens-in-place-1 ...

#time specifies the number of iterations to be simulated.
The included file 'phil.dat' is the network for the dining philosophers 
which has 10 transitions and 15 places. Note that place numbers start
at zero. Consider the following Petri net:


0 ------           | 
  |    |           |         2 ------
  | ** |---------->|           |    |
  |    |           |---------->|    |
  |    |     |---->|           |    |
  ------     |     |           |    |
             |                 ------
1 ------     |
  |    |     |
  | *  |------
  |    |
  |    |
  ------


Here is the input file for this net:

1 3 1
1.0 2 0 1 1 2
2 1 0

Now try: %petri < thisfile
