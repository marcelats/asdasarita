NAME
     deq - ordinary differential equation solver

DESCRIPTION
     deq is a graphics tool for the investigation  of  dif-
     ferential equations.  The program is interactive, asking for
     either a system of first-order equations or  a  higher-order
     equation, as well as the time constraints and initial condi-
     tions.  The equation or system of equations is parsed and  a
     new  c source file is generated, which then must be compiled
     and run.  The resulting generated data is finally piped into
     grtool.   Thus, a path to grtool must be available from your
     current directory.

STARTUP
     deq

PROMPTS
     deq will prompt you for the necessary  information  in
     the following format:

          Which do you want to enter, a (S)ystem of 1st-order

                          or a (H)igher-order equation.

          Enter 's' or 'h': s

          Enter dimension of system: 3

          x[1]' = 10.0*(-x[1]+x[2])

          x[2]' = 28.0*x[1]-x[2]-x[1]*x[3]

          x[3]' = -2.66666666 * x[3] + x[1] * x[2]

          Enter initial conditions.

          x[0] = 5.0

          x[1] = 5.0

          x[2] = 5.O

          Enter another set of initial conditions? (y/n) n

          start time = 0

          end time = 20

          time step size = 0.01

          Plot what vs. what?

          x-axis (t or x[i]): x[1]

          y-axis (t, x[i], or a): x[2]


     This is the famous Lorenz euations  with  an  attractor.  In
     this  example,  the x[i]s are related only in the way speci-
     fied. But in a higher-order equation, x[i] indicates the  i-
     th derivative of x and x[0] = x.  Depending on the degree of
     the equation, a number  of  initial  conditions  are  taken.
     Note  that you can provide more than one set of initial con-
     ditions.  They will be plotted on the same plot.

     The following c functions are supported:
            sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, atan2, sinh,
            cosh, tanh, exp, log, log10, pow, sqrt, fabs.

     The symbol '^' can also be used to indicate the power  func-
     tion.


Internals:
     First, the equation is parsed and transformed into a  system
     of  first-order  equations  (if  it  is  not already in that
     form.)  Then this system of equations is piped into  another
     parser,  which  actually  generates the c source code.  This
     code is compiled and run, generating the raw data, which  is
     finally  piped  into  grtool  to  come up with a plot of the
     solution.  The batch file  will  keep  you  abreast  of  the
     status of this process.
