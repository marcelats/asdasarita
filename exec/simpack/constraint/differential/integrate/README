FYI: For a program that accepts equations in standard form and then
plots results, see the 'deq' sub-directory.

NOTE: You should have a plotting package with these programs. gnuplot
and xvgr are freely available. For UNIX, in general, you should look at
the 'plot' and 'graph' man pages. See further information in the 'deq'
subdirectory on how to obtain xvgr and gnuplot.
----------------------------

The routines in this directory are for simulating differential equations.
'conte' and 'contrk' are for simulating the following equation:


x''' + x' = 2
with initial conditions x(0)=x'(0)=x''(0)=1

using Euler's method and Runge-Kutta (RK) (order 4) to numerically integrate
the systems. To see a graph, try:

%contrk > dump.plot
%gnuplot


Note that the equation is written in routine 'state()' and the
initial conditions are in 'init_conditions()'. The equation(s) you
want to simulate are placed in first order form first.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The remaining programs all use RK4 for integration. Plot the trajectories
as previously shown:

1. The Lorenz System - a chaotic attractor in phase space

2. Lotka Volterra predator prey model

3. Vibration - forced linear vibrations (wave packets). A time series plot.

4. Silnikov - homoclinic orbits in phase space.
