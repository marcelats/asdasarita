This contains two versions of the logistic equation (or quadratic system)
and a bifurcation parameter plot.

The equations are difference equations. There are two ways of coding
difference equations: 

 (1) break down the equations to first order form just as for 
     differential equations. Look at 'log1' and 'log2' for an 
     example of this approach.

 (2) Use a circular queue. See 'diff1' which is the same as
     'log1' except that a circular queue is used. 


For the bifurcation plot, plot the points as points (not using lines).
