BOOK: Simulation Model Design & Execution: Building Digital Worlds
AUTHOR: Paul Fishwick 
PUBLISHER: Prentice Hall 
PHONE: (800) 947-7700
ISBN: 013-098609-7
DATE: January 1995

This book focusses on model design (using an extension of object-oriented 
design -- called multimodeling) and algorithms for serial and parallel 
model execution. The SimPack simulation toolkit is also discussed and a
chapter is devoted to using SimPack programs. The Introduction Chapter, 
with embedded figures, in online in World Wide Web (WWW) format in my 
home page. This chapter will give you a good idea of the book's content 
and philosophy. You will need to use a WWW client program such as Mosaic, 
Netscape, Cello or Lynx to view the chapter. My home page is:
