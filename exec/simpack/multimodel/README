combined:  

This program represents a combined simulation where there
is a grocery store clerk with a food delivery belt. Discrete event
routines are used to model inter-arrivals and server (i.e. clerk)
time, and a simple continuous model is used to model a conveyor belt
that operates at precisely 2 feet per time unit (using the differential
equation x' = 2). The belt is 3 feet long. The information on the
queuing routines is found in the 'queuing' subdirectory.


bwater:

This is the boiling water multimodel described in the paper:

   Paul A. Fishwick and Bernard P. Zeigler.  ``A Multimodel Methodology
   for Qualitative Model Engineering''.   ACM Transactions on Modelling
   and Computer Simulation.  Volume 2, Issue 1, 1992, pp.  52 - 81.

The simulation is of a six phase FSA controlling differential equation
based systems.



Suggested Usage
---------------

%combined

--- see statistical summary ---

%combined2 > combined2.pnts

Use a plotting program, such as gnuplot to
see the points.

%bwater < bwater.in > bwater.out

Use a plotting program, such as gnuplot to
