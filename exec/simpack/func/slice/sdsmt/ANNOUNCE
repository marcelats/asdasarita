         ANNOUNCEMENT: NEW SYSTEM DYNAMICS TOOL USING X WINDOWS
                           SimPack Toolkit


There is a new System Dynamics tool under X windows called 'sdsmt' produced
as a simulation class assignment. If you are interested in trying it,
you can find the compressed tar file, via anonymous ftp, at:

 ftp.cis.ufl.edu/pub/fishwick/sdsmt.tar.Z

The file includes an executable for the Sun SPARC 4 but it may also be
implemented on other machines using X windows (we have not ported it,
however). The graphical user interface was built using Tk/Tcl. Full
documentation is available for the tool in the form of the README file
and the Postscript documentation in DOC.PS.

If you have any suggestions for improvement or find bugs, please contact
Mr. Tsae-Feng Yu at yu@cis.ufl.edu who will make changes as he has time
in his schedule. Also, please cc: messages to me. Have fun!
