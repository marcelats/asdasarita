First of all, I would say that I have really appreciated
your endeavour to developing SDSMT.
I'm an old System Dynamics practitioner, but, working
within a Centre for the History of Technology, the
history of SD has become my first job (and software
aspects play an important part).
Unfortunately, I don't have a X-Windows machine in order
to test SDSMT. Browsing your manual and the source code, 
it would seem that some classical and important features 
as DELAY or TABLE, are not included in SDSMT. Do you think 
of developing further the package?
I would inform you that there is a discussion list in System
Dynamics <system-dynamics@world.std.com> at the listserver
<majordomo@world.std.com>, where you could send the SDSMT
announcement. [Also, there are lists in Learning Organizations
(<learning-org@world.std.com>, listserver: <majordomo>) and
in Business Process Reengineering (<bpr-l@duticai.twi.tudelft.nl>,
listserver: <listserv>) where languages such as STELLA or iThink
are often mentioned, even though the main interest is not on 
software tools].
Problably, software vendors could be not very happy for this
"intrusion", but my opinion (see pag.495-501 in "Computer-Based 
Management of Complex Systems", eds. P.M.Milling and E.O.K.Zahn,
Springer-Verlag, Berlin - New York, 1989) is that System Dynamics
methodology has not spread enough even cause of the lack of a
public domain software; and, during the Stuttgart Conference,
I tried to demonstrate that a growth in the SD field due to
public domain software would increase also the billing of the
software houses.
To be exact, SDSMT is not the first p.d. software in SD.
I'm speaking of NDTRAN, developed at the University of 
Notre Dame by I.J.Uhran and W.I.Davisson at the end of the 
seventies ["IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics",
vol. SMC-14, no. 6, Nov-Dec. 1984, pag. 837-846]. But those 
are days of difficult communications. The package has been 
released to SHARE (IBM), DECUS (DEC), HUE (Harris) and EXUG 
(Honeywell), but never I have found it quoted, neither, now, I 
can locate it in the Net. If you succeed, please, let me 
know.
Finally, I would like to submit you (and eventually discuss,
notwithstanding my faulty English) the need of software tools
for simulation and modeling. I'm thinking to inter-languages
(or, better, dialects) translators, generators of diagrams
(causal, stock&flow, etc.) from the model equations (inverting
the present trend of modeling), etc. I think that interpreters
such as (TK-)TCL or PERL are cut out for this work. 
I recognize that I'm proposing only a way to by-pass one of the 
fundamental questions (standards and lingua franca) in modeling
and simulation, but, not considering near a general consent, we
should think to patch up our disciplines.

Thanks for your attention.
