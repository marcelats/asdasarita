    and includes all original source code and accompanying documentation, 
    as well as this license.  If you 
    modify Sim++ and/or incorporate it into another software product, 
    distribution of any such derived product must be under the same terms 
    and conditions as those in this Sim++ License.

    your possession which constitute any derived product(s).  We may
    terminate your license upon notice, in the event that you violate its
    terms and conditions.
