                          CHANGES FOR SimPack3

In preparing Xsimcode as part of SimPack3 (and within Sim++), the
Makefile was changed, and model.* was introduced (because it is the
default name in Xsimcode and the copy of model.* in the Xsimcode/src
directory can easily be overwritten, either intentionally or by
accident, and you might for some reason want the "original" back).

                        WHAT IS IN THIS DIRECTORY

In this directory, you'll find about half a dozen models (*.sim)
already created by Xsimcode, along with corresponding files (*.c)
automatically generated by Xsimcode.  The installation procedure for
SimPack3 permits you to create executables for all the examples as
part of the SimPack3 install procedure.

Some examples of simulation models are already built for you.  They
are in *.sim, and you can copy them into Xsimcode/src directory, then
run Xsimcode, and you will be able to access all these models.  We
keep them in a separate directory (1) to keep the Xsimcode/src
directory simpler, and (2) in case you accidentally change them with
Xsimcode you have copies of the "originals" here to fall back on.

See the readme in Xsimcode/src for more on getting into Xsimcode and
using these models.  See also the older but also informative
simpack/func/event/pkgs/Xsimcode/README.

If you plan to use Xsimcode, you'll have to "make" whatever .c file
Xsimcode creates for you.  You can use the Makefile here as a
template.  "make all" generates ALL executables.  "make" with no 
name specified makes "model" (the Xsimcode default name).
