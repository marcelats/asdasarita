11/94	Reworked grammar to allow more flexible ordering of statements 
        in a mini-gpss program.  

        Added unconditional transfer and both-mode transfer to permit
        more flexible branching.

        Added RVNORM, RVEXPO, RVUNI, and RVERL to permit sampling from random
        variate normal, exponential, uniform, and erlang distributions.  These
        may be used with GENERATE and ADVANCE constructs to vary inter-arrival
        times and service times, respectively.

        Modified grammar to permit verbose labeling of statements.  Labels may
        preface all statements except Advance and Generate statements.  Future
        work may entail branching to any label in a GPSS program.

        Added the PRIORITY construct to allow modification of an entity's 
        priority.  This construct may be used after a GENERATE construct and/or
        before a QUEUE construct.

        Modified grammar to permit a GENERATE construct to follow a TRANSFER
        construct to allow more flexible networks to be created in mini-gpss.

        Future work may entail modifying the grammar to permit any sequence of
        statements to follow another.  Current implementation enforces a 
        relatively narrow sequence of statements to precede/suceed each other.
        Summary queue statistics and more detailed facility utilization reports
        are others areas for further work.
