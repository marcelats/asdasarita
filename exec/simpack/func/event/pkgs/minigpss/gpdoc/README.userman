        (1)  Creating a MINI-GPSS program 

            Write a MINI-GPSS simulation program.  The syntax to a     

            MINI-GPSS program is described under the section

            MINI-GPSS Program Syntax.

        (2)  Executing the MINI-GPSS simulator 

            The file that you created in (1) is the source-file.

            Type at the system prompt:

                 gp < source-file 
             
             At this point, if there are syntax errors the simulator

             will specify the error and the line where the error

             is located.  If there are no syntax errors, the simulator

             will produce the simulation output and will generate

             "C" equivalent code to the simulation.  The "C" generated

             code is located in the file simgen.c.  To compile simgen.c,

             type at the system prompt:

                 cc -o simgen simgen.c queuing.o -lm -lcurses -ltermcap 

             To run the executable (simgen), type at the system prompt:

                 simgen
