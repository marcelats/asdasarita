version 1: for  cAPI code fragments in Sim++ manual 
version 2: for ooAPI code fragments in Sim++ manual
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The idea behind this simulation loosely resembles the arrival of
passengers at an airport, whereupon they give their luggage to one of
several skycaps and then check in at the ticket counter.  Each skycap
is a single-server facility, and has his/her own queue.  The
ticket-counter, by contrast, is a multi-server facility, with a single
queue.  These attributes match those typical of many real airport
situations.

The purpose of this program is to test code fragments which are
examples in the Sim++ manual.  The code sequences below do not
represent a sane attempt at a single simulation program; rather, it is
a cut and paste FROM the manual, almost entirely in sequential order
as the examples appear in the manual.  The purpose here is solely to
ensure that all the code fragments presented in the Sim++ manual are
free of syntax errors, and actually run.  Please DON'T use either
version of airport as an example of a simulation program, because it
has NO overall semantics!  (There ARE over 30 complete example programs
for you to peruse, please refer to them to gain an overall idea of
how to use Sim++).

Version 1 tests the cAPI portion of the manual; version 2 tests the
ooAPI portion of the manual.

To translate and run either version:

    translat 1
    airport > out
    more out

    translat 2
    airport > out
    more out

Output for versions 1 and 2 have been saved as out1 and out2, respectively.
