There are two versions of the same program in this directory: version 1 uses
the cAPI; version 2 uses the ooAPI.  Both are equivalent in their effect.

The program is the ssq example, but modified to perform repeated simulations.
Each iteration provides different output, because it is baased on a pseudo-
random sequence.  After performing multiple iterations, the output can be
subjected to statistical analysis, and statistical inferences may be drawn.

Iteration involves (for cAPI) using end_simpack(); or (for ooAPI) using
destructors for Future and all facilities.

WARNING: the iteration feature is NOT officially supported yet, altho it
appears to work after limited testing.  The reason it is not supported is that
we need to overload the assignment operator for classes which contain
dynamically-allocated data; otherwise, orphaned pointers can cause failures
due to unpredictable side-effects which are VERY difficult to diagnose.  There
was not time to write the needed methods and test adequately prior to release.
The code is included so that you can use this feature if you wish.  As long as
you do not use assignment (=) to copy Future or Facility objects, it will
probably work ok.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build one of the two examples:

    "translat 1" to build the cAPI version
    "translat 2" to build the cAPI version

After you translate, run the program with a command line parameter to specify
the number of iterations, eg,

    iterate 10

or

    iterate 100 > out.100
